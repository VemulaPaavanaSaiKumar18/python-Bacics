# You are going to write a program that tests the compatibility between two people.

# To work out the love score between two people:

# Take both people's names and check for the number of times the letters in the word TRUE occurs.

# Then check for the number of times the letters in the word LOVE occurs.

# Then combine these numbers to make a 2 digit number.

# For Love Scores less than 10 or greater than 90, the message should be:

# "Your score is *x*, you go together like coke and mentos."
# For Love Scores between 40 and 50, the message should be:

# "Your score is *y*, you are alright together."
# Otherwise, the message will just be their score. e.g.:

# "Your score is *z*."
# e.g.

# name1 = "Angela Yu"
# name2 = "Jack Bauer"
# T occurs 0 times

# R occurs 1 time

# U occurs 2 times

# E occurs 2 times

# Total = 5

# L occurs 1 time

# O occurs 0 times

# V occurs 0 times

# E occurs 2 times

# Total = 3

# Love Score = 53

# Print: "Your score is 53."

# These functions will help you:
# lower() count()

# Example Input 1
# Kanye West
# Kim Kardashian
# Example Output 1
# The Love Calculator is calculating your score...
# Your score is 42, you are alright together.
# Example Input 2
# Brad Pitt
# Jennifer Aniston
# Example Output 2
# The Love Calculator is calculating your score...
# Your score is 73.
# Hint
# You can check your values against mine using this table:

# Name 1	Name 2	Score
# Brad Pitt	Jennifer Aniston	73
# Prince William	Kate Middleton	67
# Ashton Kutcher	Mila Kunis	63
# Angela Yu	Jack Bauer	53
# David Beckham	Victoria Beckham	45
# Mario	Princess Peach	43
# Kanye West	Kim Kardashian	42
